// Define a Constructor Function
// Constructors are functions that create new objects. They define properties and behaviors that will belong to the new object. Think of them as a blueprint for the creation of new objects.

// Here is an example of a constructor:

function Dog(){
  this.name="sdfvg";
  this.color="sdfv";
  this.numLegs=3;
}
